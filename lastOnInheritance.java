//multiple and hybrid doesnot work because if we make same function in two different class and call those class in 
//child class, then it will show ambiguity error

//hybrid is the combination of any four inheritance, hybrid inheritance is also known as diamond problem
//in inheritance not all property get inherited into another class , only function ,  if there is constructor in parent class,
//then it wont get inherited into child class
 
//1. private method is also not get inherited into child from parent
//2.  constructor never get inherit

//object class is the parent class of all the classe
//and if there is no extended, then by default it extends object class 
//there is only and only one super class in whole program


//There are two types of relationShip
//1.inheritance (Is-A)
//2. Association (has-A)
//   there are two types of association
//   2a) Aggregation (weak bonding)
//   2b) Composition (Strong bonding)
